# What does this graph tell me?

***
  
This graph shows the percent of total hillslope area that contributes a certain amount of sediment yield. 

For instance, if the total hillslope area (x-axis) is 30% and the corresponding sediment yield (y-axis) is 75%, it can be interpreted that 75% of the total sediment yield is contributed by 30% of the total watershed area. 

A linear line in this graph would suggest that entire watershed contributes sediment yield equally.
