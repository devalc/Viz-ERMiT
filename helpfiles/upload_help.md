## How do I create a GeoParquet file from my ERMiT runs?

We are working seamless integration of Viz-ERMiT on WEPPcloud so that you can directly start exploring the ERMiT results.

In the mean time, if you want to visualize your results with Viz-ERMiT, please drop us a line at:

Chinmay Deval: deva4998@vandals.uidaho.edu
Mariana Dobre: mdobre@uidaho.edu

We will be happy to assist you with a program which, with a little customization, will automatically generate GeoParquet file for your runs.
